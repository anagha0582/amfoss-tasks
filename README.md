## Introspection
I took computer science in school and i have learnt python programming in the last two years. over the years i have acquired some experience in coding. for the next 6 months i would like to learn more coding. i would contibute back to the club by taking part in competitions and hackathons and ensuring that our team succeeds. the selection process was a bit hard for me but definitely a new learning experience.
