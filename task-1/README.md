## Star all the repositories (task-1)
I followed the instuction given in the repository. I signed up in my github account on my browser and authorised the setup. Then, I ran the code but the link didnt open at first so i manually opened it in my web browser. The script ran for a while and I ensured that it ran until the end. At the end, it displayed "Starring done". After all the setting up, I felt satisfied to complete the first task :)
