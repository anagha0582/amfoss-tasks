# INTROSPECTION
## Why must we choose you?
I took computer science in 11th and 12th and I studied python. I studied a bit of coding and i liked it. For my computer project in 12th i designed a simple game by coding with my teammates and i loved that a lot. I think by joining AMFOSS, i'll be able to learn more about coding and other programming languages. I feel like i will be a good team player and i'll learn a lot from my teammates. I would love to learn a lot more about coding.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In the next 6 months I would like to be a bit more comfortable in coding and learn new programming languages. I feel like it will be easier if i join AMFOSS. 

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I would try to ensure that our team succeeds with all tasks and i would like to help people with what i know.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
It was a bit hard for me, but I can definutely agree that it was a learning experience for me. I felt satisfied after completing the tasks. I was not able to complete everything but I have tried my best.
